# Task 3: Tracing the Sequential Pathways of Trump-Related Conspiracy Theories on YouTube

We began by filtering Trump-related YouTube videos, isolating those containing five specific conspiracy keywords. A time-series analysis of these videos revealed two primary peaks in content volume: October 2018, coinciding with the U.S. midterm elections, and November 2019, aligning with the start of impeachment discussions. Given the significance of these periods, we focused our analysis on them, selecting three major channel categoriesâ€”News & Politics, People & Blogs, and Entertainment. To examine the dissemination pattern across these channels, we employed convolution and normalization techniques to calculate the relative time lags in content release. Cross-correlation analysis allowed us to establish the temporal order of content publication, revealing that conspiracy content typically first appeared in People & Blogs, followed by News & Politics, and lastly in Entertainment. This sequence suggests a path of initial public response, subsequent journalistic coverage, and eventual entertainment adaptation, highlighting the dynamics of conspiracy theory spread across different channel types.
