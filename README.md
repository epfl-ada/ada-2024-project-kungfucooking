# Task 1: Time Series Analysis of Conspiracy Propagation
## Research Questions
How did Trump use conspiracy theories to gain attention on YouTube? What is the trajectory of the dissemination of conspiracy theory-related content?
## Project Plans & Methods
Relevant videos were first filtered by conspiracy theory-related words (e.g., ‘QAnon’, ‘Deep State’, etc.) appearing in titles, descriptions, or tags.
In order to control for variables, the categories to which the videos belonged were counted, and the four categories that accounted for the largest share of the videos (about 90% in total) were selected, while some obviously irrelevant videos could be filtered (e.g. Autos & Vehicles)
Finally, time series analysis was performed to analyze the frequency of posting, views and interactions of these videos over time. In order to reduce the impact of fluctuations, a monthly aggregation was used to observe the overall trend. At the same time, the data was normalized in order to be able to put the number of views, subscriptions and videos per unit of time change in the same graph, without affecting the trend.
